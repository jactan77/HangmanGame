# HangmanGame Project Summary

## Project Overview
The HangmanGame is a JavaFX application that allows users to play the classic game of Hangman with customizable word categories.

## Dependencies and Structure
- **JavaFX Controls & FXML**: Utilized for building UI components and managing layout with FXML files.
- **FormsFX**: Handles form elements and user input.
- **JavaFX Media**: Provides sound effects to enhance user interaction.
- **JUnit**: Employed for testing purposes.
- **SQLite JDBC**: Manages database connectivity for storing words and categories.

## Category Selection Logic
- **CategoryViewController.java**: Manages both predefined and user-defined categories, dynamically generating buttons for each category.

## Game Logic and UI Interactions
- **Controller.java**: Contains the logic for word guessing, manages user interactions, and coordinates animations.
- **HangmanAnimation.java**: Implements animations for drawing the hangman as incorrect guesses are made.

## Database Interactions
- **Db.java**: Handles all database operations including retrieving, adding, and deleting words and categories. Utilizes a singleton pattern to maintain a single database connection.

## Application Lifecycle and Scene Management
- **Main.java**: Acts as the entry point, manages the lifecycle of the application, and handles transitions between different scenes such as menu, category selection, and game scenes.

## Menu Interactions and Scene Transitions
- **MenuController.java**: Handles user interactions in the main menu, providing navigation to different scenes like starting the game or accessing settings.

## User-Defined Word Sets
- **SetsController.java**: Allows users to create and manage custom word sets, integrating with the database to store user inputs.

## Animation Effects
- **HangmanAnimation.java**: Uses JavaFX's ScaleTransition to animate the hangman drawing incrementally with each wrong guess.

## Sound Effects
- **UISoundEffects.java**: Manages auditory feedback using AudioClip for interactions and animations, enhancing user experience.

## Modular Structure and JavaFX Requirements
- **module-info.java**: Defines the module dependencies required for the application, including JavaFX and database modules.

This comprehensive summary captures the key features and technical setup of the HangmanGame project, highlighting its modular design and interactive capabilities.
